# About

Easily manage the settings in your [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) plugin.

This module can:
* manage different types of variables (bool, string, color, integer, double)
* read and write in QGIS settings or in the project settings
* can set and get values of widgets in dialogs

## Installing the module

To use this module you can easily copy the files and put them in your project.
A more elegant way is to use git submodule. Hence, you can keep up with latest improvements. In you plugin directory, do

```
git submodule add git://github.com/3nids/qgissettingmanager.git
```

Then, import the needed classes:

```python
from qgissettingmanager import *
```

## The main setting class

All your settings will be saved in a single class, which will subclass SettingManager.

```python
class MySettings(SettingManager):
    def __init__(self):
        SettingManager.__init__(self, myPluginName)
        self.addSetting("myVariable", "bool", "global", True)
```
    
You add as many settings as you want using _addSetting_ method:

```python
addSetting(name, settingType, scope, defaultValue, options={})
```

* **name**: the name of the setting
* **settingType**: bool, string, color, integer or double
* **scope**: global or project
* **defaultValue**: the default value of the setting (type must corrsepond)
* **options**: a dictionary of options

Options are related to the type of setting
* **comboMode**: data (default) or text. Used for combo boxes for strings. It determines if the setting value correspond to the text in the combo box or to its [data](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qcombobox.html#itemData)

## Access the settings

Instantiate your settings class in your current class:

```python
import MySettings
self.settings = MySettings()
```

The settings are easily accessed using the `value` and `setValue` methods:

```python
myVariable = self.settings.value("myVariable")
self.settings.setValue("myVariable", False)
```

## Match settings with widgets of a dialog

### Quick start

You can associate a setting to a defined widget in a dialog (or a dockable window). The first point is to **name the widget as the setting name**.
Then, your dialog class subclasses the `SettingDialog` class:

```python
class MyDialog(QDialog, Ui_myDialog, SettingDialog):
    def __init__(self):
        QDialog.__init__(self)
        self.setupUi(self)
        self.settings = MySettings()
        SettingDialog.__init__(self, self.settings)
```

Hence, must dialog is shown, all widgets which are named as some setting will be set to the corresponding value. On dialog acceptance, the setting will be set according to their widget.

To control which setting has been associated to a widget, you can write in your class `print self.widgetList()`.

### Settings' update behavior

You can have a different behavior using `SettingDialog` parameters:

```
SettingDialog(settingManager, setValuesOnDialogAccepted=True, setValueOnWidgetUpdate=False)
```

* setValuesOnDialogAccepted: if `True`, settings values are set when dialog is accepted;
* setValueOnWidgetUpdate: if `True`, settings are set as soon as the widgets is modified.

### Check something before updating the settings

You can override the `SettingDialog.onBeforeAcceptDialog()` method to check your settings.
Settings will be saved only if method returns `True`.

### Using showEvent

Be warned that `SettingDialog` implements `showEvent` method. Therefore, if you redefine it in your dialog class, you have to write:

```python
def showEvent(self, e):
    settingDialog.showEvent(self, e)
    # do your own stuff
```
    
### Possible widgets

The widgets are automatically detected by the manager. If the type of widget is not handled, an error is raised.

**Strings**
* QLineEdit
* QComboBox (can be set using the itemData or the text, see options above)
* QButtonGroup (the setting is set as the checked widget text in the button group)

**Booleans**
* QCheckBox
* Any checkable widget (groupbox, etc.)

**Colors**
* Any widget but labels or pushbuttons are recommended (it uses QGIS [color button](http://qgis.org/api/classQgsColorButton.html))

**Integers**
* QLineEdit
* QSpinBox
* QSlider
* QComboBox (setting is set as the combo box index)

**Doubles**
* QLineEdit
* QDoubleSpinBox

**Stringlist**
* QListWidget (checks items having their _text_ in the list)
* QButtonGroup (checks items having their _name_ in the list)

New types of widget are easily added, if one is missing, do not hesitate to [ask](https://github.com/3nids/qgissettingmanager/issues)!
