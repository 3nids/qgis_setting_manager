# About

Easily manage the settings in your [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) plugin.

This module can:
* manage different types of variables (bool, string, color, integer, double)
* read and write in QGIS settings or in the project settings
* can set and get values of widgets in dialogs

## Installing the module

To use this module you can easily copy the files and put them in your project.
A more elegant way is to use git submodule. Hence, you can keep up with latest improvements. In you plugin directory, do

`git submodule add git://github.com/3nids/qgissettingmanager.git`

Then, import the needed classes:

`from qgissettingmanager import settingmanager`
